When you play with a gamepad, this mod will make the distance of the aiming cursor to the player longer and adaptive. The main adapting factor is how far away the enemy you are aiming at is. There are some other factors taken into consideration to make the automatic movement of the aiming cursor smooth and comfortable. This mod does NOT apply auto-aiming, but makes it easier for you to visualize your aim direction.

Don't use this mod if you play with mouse and keyboard.
